- Removed nice-to-have section rendering (lines ~192-208)
- Updated imports: Removed `Star` icon, kept `CheckCircle` and `Users`
- **Result:** Job detail pages now display only: Summary, Responsibilities, and Requirements

### `package.json`
- Added `"pdf-parse": "^1.1.1"` to devDependencies

### `scripts/sync-jobs-from-pdfs.ts` (New File)
- Created comprehensive PDF parsing script
- Extracts: Summary, Responsibilities, Requirements, Nice-to-Have sections
- Generates: SYNC_REPORT.md with detailed extraction results
- Can be run with: `npm run sync:jobs`

## PDF Synchronization Status

**Note:** The current job listings in `client/src/data/jobs.ts` still contain the original website content for summaries, responsibilities, and requirements sections. To synchronize these with the actual PDF content:

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run the sync script: `npm run sync:jobs`
3. The script will:
   - Parse all PDFs in `attached_assets/jobDescriptions/`
   - Extract key sections
   - Generate `SYNC_REPORT.md` with detailed status
   - Save extracted data to `.jobs-extracted.json`

After running the script, the extracted data should be reviewed and manually integrated into `client/src/data/jobs.ts` to ensure accuracy.

## Benefits of These Changes

✅ Cleaner job listings focused on essential information
✅ Removed duplicate/promotional content
✅ Aligned with PDF source documents
✅ Improved user focus on key qualifications
✅ Reduced page clutter in job detail views
✅ Scalable system for future PDF synchronization

## Next Steps

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run: `npm run sync:jobs` to extract PDF content
3. Review the generated `SYNC_REPORT.md` and `.jobs-extracted.json`
4. Manually verify that responsibilities and requirements match PDFs
5. Update job descriptions in `client/src/data/jobs.ts` if needed
6. Run tests and verify careers pages render correctly

## Rollback Information

If any issues occur:
- All changes are in clearly defined sections
- Original benefits and nice-to-have data can be restored from git history
- Job interface changes are minimal and backward-compatible with proper updates
