A. Navigation
1. Fix the “About Us” and “Impact” items in the top nav:  
   • Make them smooth-scroll to the existing #about and #impact section IDs on the Home page, or route to /about and /impact pages if you already split them.  
   • Ensure active-link underline still works in EN & AR.

B. Contact Information
2. Update all visible contact details site-wide:  
   • Phone: **+966 538 104 164**  
   • Email: **info@nawa.sa**  
   • WhatsApp link: `https://wa.me/966538104164` (same number).  
   • Replace every old value in footers, headers, and the contact form auto-reply.

3. Address: replace with  
   **“7915 King Abdul Aziz Rd, An Nahdah District, Jeddah 23523”**  
   Display in both languages; use proper RTL alignment in Arabic.

4. Google Maps:  
   • Embed an <iframe> map in the Contact page using this address (17:9 aspect, rounded corners, lazy-loaded).  
   • Add a `loading="lazy"` attribute for performance.

C. Missing Legal Pages
5. Create `/privacy-policy` and `/terms-of-service` pages (and Arabic equivalents `/ar/privacy-policy`, `/ar/terms-of-service`).  
   • Simple h1 + placeholder lorem text for now.  
   • Ensure footer links now point to these routes (no 404s).

D. Program Sub-Pages
6. Generate three new pages under `/programs` (EN) and `/ar/programs`:  
   • `/programs/nawa-career` (Arabic `/ar/programs/nawa-career`)  
   • `/programs/nawa-conferences` (Arabic `/ar/programs/nawa-conferences`)  
   • `/programs/saudi-mun-association` (Arabic `/ar/programs/saudi-mun-association`)  
   Each page needs: hero banner, one-paragraph overview, bullet outcomes, a “Sponsor this program” CTA button that scrolls to Contact.  
   Update the Programs & Services page cards so “Learn more” links route to these pages.

E. Assets
7. Replace the Saudi MUN Association logo background:  
   • In `/public/assets/sma-logo.svg` (or .png), change background rectangle to **#000000** (black) instead of green.  
   • Make sure it still looks crisp on white/neutral sections.

F. i18n
8. Mirror all text/links above in Arabic JSON files; keep phone, email, and map identical.

After these updates, run the dev server so I can verify. No other content or styling should be altered.
